## Web developer

I have been preparing myself for 2 years in web development, starting with front-end technologies, beginning with HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. During this process I've participated in guided projects and taken courses and certifications to master these skills, projects that I've shared here.

I have also done complete projects with WordPress, integrating e-coomerce and common functions on websites.

I graduated from university as an industrial engineer and worked in multinational electronics industries for 3 years. In this period I collaborated in large teams, implementing methodologies for project management and execution, as well as process optimisation. 
Since university I have had a great interest in programming, that's why I decided in the last years to focus on this web developing area, 

I continue to learn to complete my training in front-end, and I intend to gain knowledge and experience with data analysis and back-end.
